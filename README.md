# # 06 Server-Side APIs

## Our Task

Our task was to create a Weather Dashboard that used server-side API's and the user was able to search a city and see that cities current forecast.
On from that the user requested to see UV levels and whether they are favourable, moderate or severe for the searched city and also see the 5 day forecast for the city.

Below you will see the mock up example we were given as a template

Firstly, I just made sure that my html was simple and matched the example to the best of my ability, I then signed up for the open weather api, gaining my unqiue key

Overall I thought it was pretty straight forward it was just that we had never done anything like this before.

I had some issues with git guardian and an open api leak, see the images below

After Speaking to BCS on that I discovered it was ok but not good practice and we would learn more eventually

I added the UV index as per next image
